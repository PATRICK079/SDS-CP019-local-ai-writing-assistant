# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the --project name-- repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

## About This Project
In this repository, youâ€™ll find the work carried out by our community members in completing an end-to-end machine learning project. Please note that the resources available here is not to be used or copied without referencing the appropriate authors.

## Project Phases & Timeline

**Data Cleaning & Analysis (Week 1)**
- Handling null values, fixing data types, data inconsistencies
- EDA, understanding distributions, outliers, relationships of features with target variable
- Feature Selection using correlation analysis, ANOVA tests, F-test, etc.

**Feature Engineering & Model Selection (Week 2 & 3)**
- Building new features, one hot encoding, feature scaling
- Handling outliers through statistical and heuristic methods
- Normalisation or Standardisation of input features is the ML algorithm in the pipeline requires it
- Model training, comparison and selection
- Model evaluation and Optimization using K-fold cross validation, hyperparameter tuning

**Deployment (Week 4)**
- Building a streamlit app
- Deploying model to app
- Deploying app to streamlit cloud
